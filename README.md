# Loan-Risk-Prediction-


###  Discription

The aim of this project is to predict loan credit risk and determine the probability
of non-payment of bank financial services (e.g., whether a person will pay back a
loan or not). By using scoring models that are AI-based and use deep learning,
banks and financial institutions can access more realistic predictions on credit risk,
using customers’ credit history and the power of big data. This way credit can be
approved to the right people and better pricing options offered to people who
deserve it.

### Dataset Description:
Note: This dataset contains 24 variables that are explained in detail in the
LoanRiskDataDescription.csv file found with the dataset
Dependent variable: LoanRiskScore

### Milestone 1 tasks:
1. Apply pre-processing on the provided dataset. (You must use an encoding
technique on at least one feature)
2. Apply Feature Selection and Experiment with regression techniques to
reduce the error on prediction of the loan risk score (Deliver at least two
different regression techniques).


### Milestone 2: 
An updated dataset will be provided for each project in the second milestone.
Updated Dataset Description:
▪ The “LoanRiskScore” column used in the previous milestone as the
actual output has been removed.
▪ A New “ProsperRating (Alpha)” column has been added instead. Each
loan can have a risk rate that is either {A, AA, B, C, D, E or HR}.

### Milestone 2 Tasks:
1. Split your dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.
2. Train at least 3 models to classify each sample into distinct classes.
3. Choose at least two hyperparameters to vary. Study at least three
different choices for each hyperparameter. When varying one
hyperparameter, all the other hyperparameters should be fixed.

#### Note : 
Classify a loan into one of seven categories: {A, AA, B, C, D, E or HR} based
on the provided features in the updated dataset.
